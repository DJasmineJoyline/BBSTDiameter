# BBSTDiameter
Implement a C program to find the diameter of a BST.  The diameter of a tree (sometimes called the width) is the number of nodes on the longest path between two leaves in the tree.  [Hint:  The diameter of a tree T is the largest of the following quantities:  the diameter of T’s left subtree  the diameter of T’s right subtree  the longest path between leaves that goes through the root of T (this can be computed from the heights of the subtrees of T)     Input and Output Format:  Refer Sample Input and Output for formatting specifications.     [All text in bold corresponds to input and the rest corresponds to output]     Sample Input and Output:  Enter the element to be inserted in the tree  5  Do you want to insert another element?  yes  Enter the element to be inserted in the tree  7  Do you want to insert another element?  yes  Enter the element to be inserted in the tree  3  Do you want to insert another element?  yes  Enter the element to be inserted in the tree  1  Do you want to insert another element?  no  The elements in the tree are 1 3 5 7  The diameter of the tree is 4
